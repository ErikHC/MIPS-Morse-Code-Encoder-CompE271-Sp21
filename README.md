# MIPS-Morse-Code-Encoder-CompE271-Sp21
Using bitwise operations in MIPS to encode A-Z (upper and lower), 0-9, and '?' in International Morse code

This project is specifically made for use in the MARS 4.5 (I use MARS 4.5.1) IDE. A video demonstration of the project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On-NI-TE1LI). This tool can take all standard input as input (the caveat being that symbols like '*', '(', '%', etc. will have garbage Morse Code outputs). The tool has both audio and symbolic output where '.' is "dit" and '-' is "dah".

This tool also has the ability to (crudely) change the WPM speed to between 1 and 5 (it defaults at 1 so it's important that you change it).
